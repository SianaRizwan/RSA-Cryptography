We take two prime numbers p & q.
For public key: We choose e where e is an integer and is not a factor of n and 1<e<Q(n).
For private key: Q(n)=(p-1)(q-1).
We find d where d is the inverse of e mod Q(n).
Let p be the positional value of alphabetical chart.
For encryption (p^e mod n) .
For decryption (p^d mod n).
